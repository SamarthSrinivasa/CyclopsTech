# CyclopsTech

This repository contains files for the CyclopsTech work completed from 08/29/2024 to 09/23/2024. The camera_test.py file allows the cameras in the CyclopsTest VR Headset to capture a video of both eyes of the user wearing the headset, and write the video onto two avi files for the left and right eyeball. The other files contain a C# implementation of this approach, however there are some issues with using the OpenCV Library. 

### camera_test.py

Python file for capturing output from Headset, then writing them to AVI files. 

### output1.avi & output2.avi 

AVI files of Eyeball recording 

### CMakeLists.txt, CameraApp.csproj, Program.cs, main.cpp

C# files for providing same functionality as the python script to .net users.
